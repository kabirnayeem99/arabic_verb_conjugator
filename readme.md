# Seegah Pro

When I began learning "seegah," I thought it would be nice to develop an app to help students memorize and practice seegah more easily. Currently, the app contains 1,500 verbs from the Quran, which may be sufficient for beginners. However, as I continue on this journey, I will gradually add more words.

The database, code for data scraping, algorithms for manual translations, and data normalization are all included in the repository. Feel free to use them without any need for permission.

But! Please remember this servant in your prayers.
