# Seegah Pro

As I started learning seegah, I though it would be great to develop an app to help memorize and practice seegah for the student. Currently, it only contains 1,500 verbs of Quran, maybe enough for a beginner, but as I set through my journey, slowly I will add more words. The DB, and the code for scraping the data, and algorithms for manual translations and data normalization are included in the repo, feel free to use them without any permission.

But! keep this banda in your prayer.
